# mxdownloader
A command line tool, utilizing the mangadex.org api you can download single, list, range or all chapters of a given manga. 


## About 
This is a a python cli tool that can dowload single, list, range or all chapters. The config file as of writing this (9/1/2024) can only set the path but I will add the ability to change langauge from default (en/english) to any supported langauge on mangadex via the cli.

*I couldn't find a reliable way to get all of the scanlation groups especially since this program allows downloading any chapter(s). 

If a group's name is not in this thread or would like me to post there links on the wiki more directly please let me know via the Issues section.

*Credits the devs at MangaDex for their work in making this api available to everyone. I did not intend on making this script public as it isn't an extremely complex set up.
